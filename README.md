# bmi_calculator

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation used to determine if a person is underweight, 
normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their height and weight. 
The BMI calculation is not a diagnostic tool, but it can provide a general idea of a person's body weight status.

## Getting Started

## Usage

To use the BMI Calculator, simply enter your weight in kilograms (kg) and height in meters (m) into the input field.

If you prefer to use pounds (lb) and inches (in), you can convert them to kilograms and meters using the following conversions:

weight (kg) = weight (lb) / 2.20462
height (m) = height (in) / 39.3701


## Interpretation of Results

The resulting BMI value can be interpreted using the following categories:

Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
Obese: BMI of 30 or higher


It is important to note that the BMI calculation is just a rough estimate and should not be used as a diagnostic tool. 
Other factors such as muscle mass, body composition, and overall health can affect the interpretation of BMI results.

## Conclusion

The BMI Calculator is a simple tool that can provide a general idea of a person's body weight status. 
However, it should not be used as a diagnostic tool and a healthcare professional should be consulted for a proper evaluation of body weight.
